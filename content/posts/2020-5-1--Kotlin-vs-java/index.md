### What is Kotlin?

Kotlin was designed by the legend programmers from **JetBrains** (the guys who are behind the all integrated development environments like pycharm,itelliJ and even Android Studio).

Kotlin has gained its popularity after being announced as an official launguage for android at **Google I/O in 2018**.As google also switched its major documentation regarding android development to Kotlin.

As Kotlin is a open source launguage,which is based on jvm(java virtual machine),due to its open source environment the codebase of kotlin is improving rapidly,as new features are adding day by day.
